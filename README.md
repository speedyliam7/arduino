these are simple motion detectors with the use of a pir motion senosor, ultrasonic and lcd screen it is able to print on the top row of the lcd if it detects motion
if it does not detect motion it will keep saying no motion detected with out flickering. once it detects motion it tells you and how far it is aswell as if the object is
closer than 2 meters it tells you the speed. i original used a pir motion sensor but all this can be done with an ultrasonic sensor only.
